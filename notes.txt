figured out why there were no diminishing returns: Decks had so many 4s that there was always one available to mulligan, and if there wasn't a 4 in hand, then the average value left in deck was so low that mulligans weren't worth taking.

This is solved by adding more 5s, and we start seeing diminishing returns as expected.

Mulligan value is based on how many 4s you play. As long as you have a 4 available to mulligan, you will gain value out of each additional mulligan. 

Cards like Roach very significantly increase the value of the first few mulligans.

Simulation takes into account the points lost by needing to mulligan Roach, instead of a 4. Which leads to the disparity between the calculated values and the simulated values.
